### SMPP Client (NodeJS) 

These scripts are written in Node.js that uses the SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol to send SMS messages through a specified SMPP host.

To use this script, you'll need to have Node.js and the 'smpp' library installed on your machine. You can install the 'smpp' library by running the following commands:


**Installation**

Clone this repository to your machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alcall-llc/smpp-client-nodejs.git
```
Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd smpp-client-nodejs
```

Install the required dependencies:
    
```shell
npm install
```



Once you have the necessary dependencies installed and access to an SMPP host, you can configure the script by replacing the placeholder values in the following lines of code:

```javascript
system_id: 'User', // Insert your SMPP server System_ID
password: 'password' // Insert your SMPP server password


destination_addr: '19542400000', // Replace with your destination number  
source_addr: 'Google', // Replace your source number (sender id)

short_message: 'Your verification code is  G-' + ID +ii // Replace with your message content

    batchSize: 50,  // nombre de sms par seconde
    batchInterval: 1000, // insterval de 1 seconde 
    totalToSend: 200 // nombre total de SMS Ã  envoyer

```




- Send SMS 

```shell

$ node send.js  // send single message
$ node perftest.js // send multiple messages per second
$ node stress-smsroute.js // send multiple messages per second with windows size and max sms to send

```


**Using Perftest to send Multiple messages per second**

To use the perftest.js script, you will need to open it in a code editor and configure the following values:

    SMPP HOST: the hostname or IP address of your SMPP server
    PORT: the port number to use for the SMPP connection
    USER: the system ID for authenticating with the SMPP server
    PASS: the password for authenticating with the SMPP server
    MESSAGES COUNT: the number of messages to send through the SMPP server

Once you have configured these values, you can execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell

$ node perftest.js

```
